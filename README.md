# NodeMCU-ESP8266-Arduino


I’m new to coding so I’ve created this after struggling to find really simple and well explained examples for my hobby projects.

I'm hoping to start a Youtube channel with tutorials for my examples soon.

This repository contains my NodeMCU Arduino examples, each folder contains the .ino file an image of the wiring setup and any notes to explain the setup where required.

As I’m new to coding if anyone can see any errors or improvements to my code please let me know so I can update it.

All wiring images were created using fritzing (http://fritzing.org)

I'm using the Arduino IDE downloaded from here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
